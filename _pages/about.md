I'm a second year graduate student from [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research interest lies at the intersection of deep learning, and optimization and control theory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mahyar Fazlyab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y3bmjJwAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/), Johns Hopkins University.
