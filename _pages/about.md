I'm a second-year graduate student in Data Science from [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). 
My research intersects machine learning, optimization and control theory, focusing on the safety and stability of learning-enabled autonomous systems.  

My areas of interest include neural network verification, reachability analysis, and optimal control.

Currently, I am very fortunate to work on some interesting projects with
[Prof. Mahyar Fazlyab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y3bmjJwAAAAJ&hl=en) at JHU.
